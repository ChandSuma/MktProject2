# Executive Summary

# Business Context

# Experiments

_We have two potential options to test: We can either design labels or advertising. We recommend doing both. We want to know what to highlight in our advertising and on packaging._

## Benefits

#### Tasty/Healthy/Both

## Brand Associations

#### European/Dutch/No association

## Brand Name
#### Translated/Original

## Gender

# Test Market

Test cannibalization in a test market of Beck's and Stella. Use a controlled test market.

# Recommendations

## Limitations:

Maybe we want to design a product that doesn't cannibalize our own strongly. We want to maximize our profit across our entire product portfolio instead of focusing on maximizing adoption.

Consider effects of containers: bottles versus cans; six packs versus cases.

# Conclusions

# Guidelines
Pay attention to:
1) how extraneous errors are controlled for: **history**   
2) if and how randomization is implemented,  
3) how you measure various dependent, independent, and control variables, and  
4) the statistical designs proposed and itâ€™s efficiency.

Management is concerned with a number of issues:
1) The validity of the measurements and experimental design (both internal and external),
representativeness, and reliability of the results.
2) That all relevant extraneous factors and customer characteristics are controlled for.
3) InBev would like to get a sense of the extent that Hertog Jan cannibalizes its other major brands
in the US: Becks and Stella Artois.
